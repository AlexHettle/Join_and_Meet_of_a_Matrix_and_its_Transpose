# Join_and_Meet_of_a_Matrix_and_its_Transpose
This program generates a random 5X5 zero-one matrix and then finds the join and meet of the matrix and its transpose.
The join of two matrices is the OR of the two matrices and the meet of two matrices is the AND of the two matrices. The transpose of a matrix is a matrix with its rows and columns interchanged.
